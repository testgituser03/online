# **1. Introduction to Software Requirements**  

### **What Are Software Requirements?**  
A **software requirement** is a **statement** that describes:  
‚úî What a **software system must do** (functional requirements).  
‚úî How well the system should perform (non-functional requirements).  
‚úî What constraints exist (hardware, security, performance).  

Think of software requirements as a **blueprint** that guides developers, testers, and designers.  

### **Example:** Developing a **Food Delivery App (like Uber Eats)**  
- The app **must allow** users to **search restaurants** and **place orders** (functional).  
- The app **should load within 2 seconds** and **handle 10,000 users at once** (non-functional).  

By defining requirements **before development**, we ensure that the software meets user needs **without confusion**.

# **Software Requirement Validation**  

### **What is Software Requirement Validation?**  
Software Requirement Validation ensures that the **requirements collected are correct, complete, and meet user needs** before development starts.  

It helps to:  
‚úî Identify **missing or conflicting requirements**.  
‚úî Ensure **functional & non-functional requirements** are well-defined.  
‚úî Reduce **errors early** to avoid costly fixes later.  

---

# **Techniques of Requirement Validation**  

### **1. Test Case Generation**  
‚úî Creating **test cases** based on requirements to check if the system behaves correctly.  
‚úî Helps in **identifying unclear or incorrect requirements**.  

#### **Example: Online Banking App**  
- **Requirement:** "Users must be able to transfer money."  
- **Test Case:**  
  1. Log in to the banking app.  
  2. Enter an invalid amount (e.g., negative number).  
  3. System should display an error message: **"Invalid amount entered."**  

üîπ If a requirement **cannot be tested**, it is **too vague** and needs improvement.  

---

### **2. Prototyping**  
‚úî Building a **basic version (mockup)** of the software before full development.  
‚úî Helps gather **early feedback** and refine requirements.  

#### **Example: E-Commerce Website**  
- A **prototype of the checkout page** is created.  
- Users test it and say:  
  - "We want a **guest checkout option** without signing up."  
  - "The **payment button is too small**."  
- Developers update the design **before full coding starts**.  

üîπ **Prototyping prevents major design mistakes** by validating usability early.  

---

### **3. Requirement Reviews**  
‚úî A formal process where **stakeholders review the requirements document** to check for:  
  - **Completeness** (Are all features covered?).  
  - **Clarity** (Are any requirements vague or unclear?).  
  - **Consistency** (Are there any contradictions?).  

#### **Example: Developing a Learning Management System (LMS)**  
- Requirement: "The system should support video lectures."  
- Reviewer‚Äôs Question:  
  - "Should the system allow **live streaming** or **only pre-recorded videos**?"  
  - If this is **not clear**, the requirement needs improvement.  

üîπ **Reviews help refine requirements before development begins.**  

---

### **4. Automated Consistency Analysis**  
‚úî Uses **software tools** to automatically check for **conflicting or missing requirements**.  
‚úî Helps in **large projects** where manual checking is difficult.  

#### **Example: Hospital Management System**  
- **Requirement 1:** "A patient record must be deleted after 5 years."  
- **Requirement 2:** "Patient records must be permanently stored."  
üö® **Conflict Detected!** One rule says to delete records, while another says to keep them.  

üîπ Automated tools like **IBM DOORS, Helix RM** can detect **contradictions like this automatically**.  

---

### **5. Walkthroughs**  
‚úî A step-by-step review of the requirements with the development team.  
‚úî Helps ensure **all team members understand** the requirements clearly.  

#### **Example: Building a Hotel Booking App**

- Developers and Testers ask questions like:  
  - "What happens if a user **cancels a booking** after payment?"  
  - "Should there be **penalty charges** for cancellations?"  

üîπ If any **unclear scenarios** are found, they are **documented and clarified**.  

---

### **6. Simulations**  
‚úî **Simulating real-world usage** to validate system behavior before actual coding.  
‚úî Helps check **performance, response time, and scalability**.  

#### **Example: Ride-Sharing App (Like Uber)**  
- A **simulation is run** to check:  
  - Can the system **handle 10,000 ride requests** at once?  
  - How does the app behave when **GPS signals are weak**?  
  - Does the **fare calculation** work correctly under different traffic conditions?  

üîπ Simulations **help find hidden issues** in performance and system behavior.  

---

# **5. Classical Analysis Techniques**  

Classical Analysis Techniques help in **understanding, modeling, and designing software systems** before development begins.

The **three key techniques** are:  
1. **Structured System Analysis** ‚Äì Models processes and data flows.  
2. **Petri Nets** ‚Äì Models concurrent systems and workflow.  
3. **Data Dictionary** ‚Äì Defines all data elements in a system.  

---

## **1. Structured System Analysis (SSA)**  
### **What is SSA?**  
Structured System Analysis (SSA) is a **top-down approach** used to break down a complex system into smaller, manageable parts.  
- It focuses on **data flow, processing steps, and system interactions**.  
- Uses tools like **Data Flow Diagrams (DFD), Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD), and State Transition Diagrams**.  

---

### **Key Features of SSA**  
‚úî **Modular Design** ‚Äì Breaks the system into small, well-defined components.  
‚úî **Graphical Representation** ‚Äì Uses **diagrams** to visualize the system.  
‚úî **Focus on Data Flow** ‚Äì Ensures smooth data movement within the system.  

---

### **Example: SSA in an Online Banking System**  
Let‚Äôs analyze an **Online Banking System** using **Structured System Analysis** techniques:  

1. **User logs in** üîë  
2. **User checks balance** üí∞  
3. **User transfers money** üí≥  
4. **Transaction is recorded in the database** üóÉÔ∏è  

#### **Representation Using Data Flow Diagram (DFD)**
```
  [User] ‚Üí (Login Process) ‚Üí [Account Information] ‚Üí (Display Balance)
  [User] ‚Üí (Transfer Process) ‚Üí [Transaction Database] ‚Üí (Update Balance)
```
- **Processes:** Login, Balance Check, Money Transfer.  
- **Data Stores:** Account Database, Transaction Database.  
- **External Entities:** Users, Bank Servers.  

üîπ **SSA helps in systematically analyzing each step of the process.**

## **2. Petri Nets**  
### **What are Petri Nets?**  
Petri Nets are **graphical tools** used for **modeling concurrent systems** where multiple events occur simultaneously.  
- Used for **workflow analysis, distributed systems, and automation processes**.  
- Consist of **places (states), transitions (events), and tokens (data flow).**  

---

### **Components of a Petri Net**  
‚úî **Places (‚óã)** ‚Äì Represents a **state** in the system.  
‚úî **Transitions (|)** ‚Äì Represents an **action or event**.  
‚úî **Tokens (‚óè)** ‚Äì Represents **data or activity flow**.  

---

### **Example: Petri Net in an ATM Withdrawal System**  
- **User inserts card** ‚Üí **Enters PIN** ‚Üí **Selects withdrawal amount** ‚Üí **Receives cash**.  
- Tokens **flow through different states** as the process progresses.  

#### **Graphical Representation of Petri Net**
```
  (Card Inserted) ‚óã ‚Üí | Enter PIN | ‚Üí ‚óã (PIN Verified)  
  (PIN Verified) ‚óã ‚Üí | Select Amount | ‚Üí ‚óã (Amount Confirmed)  
  (Amount Confirmed) ‚óã ‚Üí | Withdraw Cash | ‚Üí ‚óã (Transaction Complete)  
```
- **Each transition (|) triggers the next step** in the process.  
- The system waits for a **token (‚óè) to pass through each stage** before proceeding.  

üîπ **Petri Nets help in analyzing real-time, event-driven systems.**  

---

## **3. Data Dictionary**  
### **What is a Data Dictionary?**  
A **Data Dictionary** is a structured **collection of information about data elements** used in a system.

# **Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD)**  

## **What is an ER Diagram (ERD)?**  
An **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)** is a **graphical representation** of a database structure.  
- It helps in designing **how data is stored, related, and organized** in a database.  
- It represents **entities (objects), their attributes (properties), and relationships** between them.  

---

## **1. ER Diagram Notations**  

ER Diagrams use specific symbols to represent **Entities, Attributes, and Relationships**.  

| **Symbol** | **Name** | **Description** | **Example** |
|------------|---------|---------------|------------|
| üü• **Entity (Rectangle)** | **Represents objects in the database** | A person, place, or thing | `Student, Customer, Order` |
| üü° **Attribute (Oval)** | **Describes a property of an entity** | Characteristics of an entity | `Student_Name, Age, Email` |
| üîó **Relationship (Diamond)** | **Connects entities together** | Shows how entities interact | `Enrolls, Orders, Owns` |
| üîµ **Primary Key (Underlined Attribute)** | **Unique identifier for an entity** | Ensures uniqueness | `Customer_ID, Order_ID` |

---

## **2. Types of Attributes in ERD**  

### **Attributes describe characteristics of an entity. They are classified into different types:**  

| **Attribute Type** | **Description** | **Example** |
|------------------|----------------|------------|
| **Simple Attribute** | Cannot be divided further | `Student_Name, Age` |
| **Composite Attribute** | Can be divided into sub-parts | `Full Name (First Name + Last Name)` |
| **Derived Attribute (Dashed Oval)** | Value is derived from another attribute | `Age (derived from Date of Birth)` |
| **Multivalued Attribute (Double Oval)** | Can have multiple values | `Phone Numbers, Email IDs` |
| **Key Attribute (Underlined)** | Unique identifier | `Employee_ID, Order_ID` |

---

## **3. Relationship Cardinality**  

### **What is Relationship Cardinality?**  
**Cardinality** defines the **number of relationships** between entities.  
There are **three types** of relationships:  

### **3.1 One-to-One (1:1) Relationship**  
üîπ **Definition:** Each entity in **A** is related to only **one** entity in **B**.  
üîπ **Example:**  
- **A person has only one passport, and a passport belongs to only one person.**  
- **ERD Representation:**  
  ```
  [Person] ‚Äî (Has) ‚Äî [Passport]
  ```

---

### **3.2 One-to-Many (1:M) Relationship**  
üîπ **Definition:** Each entity in **A** can be related to **multiple** entities in **B**, but each entity in **B** is related to only **one** entity in **A**.  
üîπ **Example:**  
- **A teacher teaches multiple students, but a student has only one assigned teacher.**  
- **ERD Representation:**  
  ```
  [Teacher] ‚Äî (Teaches) ‚Äî ü°¢ [Student]
  ```

---

### **3.3 Many-to-Many (M:N) Relationship**  
üîπ **Definition:** Each entity in **A** can be related to **multiple** entities in **B**, and vice versa.  
üîπ **Example:**  
- **A student can enroll in multiple courses, and each course can have multiple students.**  
- **ERD Representation:**  
  ```
  [Student] ‚Äî (Enrolls In) ‚Äî ü°¢ [Course]
  ```

---

## **4. Decomposition in ERD**  

### **What is Decomposition in ERD?**  
Decomposition in ERD means **breaking a complex entity or relationship into smaller, simpler components** to **improve clarity and remove redundancy**.  

### **Example: Decomposing a Many-to-Many Relationship**  
**Problem:** In a **Student - Course** relationship (M:N), we cannot store multiple student-course mappings in one table efficiently.  

**Solution:**  
‚úî Introduce an **Intermediate Entity** (`Enrollment`).  
‚úî Convert **M:N into two 1:M relationships**.  

```
  [Student] ‚Äî (Enrolls) ‚Äî [Enrollment] ‚Äî (Belongs to) ‚Äî [Course]
```

- `Student` has **1:M** relationship with `Enrollment`.  
- `Course` has **1:M** relationship with `Enrollment`.  
- The `Enrollment` table stores **Student_ID, Course_ID, and Enrollment Date**.  

This decomposition **removes redundancy** and improves **database design efficiency**.  

---

# **Conclusion**  
‚úî **ER Diagrams visually represent databases** using **entities, attributes, and relationships**.  
‚úî **Types of Attributes** include **simple, composite, derived, multivalued, and key attributes**.  
‚úî **Relationship Cardinality (1:1, 1:M, M:N)** defines how entities relate to each other.  
‚úî **Decomposition in ERD** simplifies complex relationships and improves database efficiency. üöÄ
